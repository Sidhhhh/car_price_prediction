car price prediction 
# overview of project
This project uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict car prices based on various features such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the price of a car based on these input features.
# Model 
This project uses the random forest regressor from the scikit-learn library to predict car prices. The model is trained using the following steps:
# 1. Data Preprocessing: clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features
# 2. Model Training:  A random forest regressor is trained on the cleaned data.
# 3. Evaluation: The model is evaluated using performance metrics such Mean squared error and r2 score.
